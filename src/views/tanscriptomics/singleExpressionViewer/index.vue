        Vue CLI is based on webpack, while create-vue is based on Vite. Vite
        supports most of the configured conventions found in Vue CLI projects
        out of the box, and provides a significantly better development
        experience due to its extremely fast startup and hot-module replacement
        speed. Learn more about why we recommend Vite over webpack here.
